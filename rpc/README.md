# tendermint-rpc

A Rust implementation of the core types returned by a Tendermint node's RPC 
endpoint. These can be used to deserialize JSON-RPC responses.

All networking related features will be feature guarded to keep the
dependencies small in cases where only the core types are needed.

## Documentation

See documentation on [crates.io][docs-link].

## Client

This crate optionally provides access to different types of RPC client
functionality and different client transports based on which features you
select when using it.

Two features are provided at present.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `http-client` | Provides `HttpClient`, which is a basic RPC client that interacts with remote Tendermint nodes via **JSON-RPC over HTTP**. This client does not provide `Event` subscription functionality. See the [Tendermint RPC] for more details. |
| `websocket-client` | Provides `WebSocketClient`, which currently only provides `Event` subscription functionality over a WebSocket connection. See the [`/subscribe` endpoint] in the Tendermint RPC for more details. This client does not yet provide access to the RPC methods provided by the `Client` trait (this is planned for a future release). |

### Mock Clients

Mock clients are included when either of the `http-client` or
`websocket-client` features are enabled to aid in testing. This includes
`MockClient`, which only implements `Client` (no subscription
functionality), and `MockSubscriptionClient`, which helps you simulate
subscriptions to events being generated by a Tendermint node.

## Testing

The RPC types themselves require minimal testing, as the compiler asserts their
validity.

The RPC client is directly tested primarily through the [integration
tests](./tests/integration.rs). These tests use fixtures taken from running
Tendermint nodes to ensure compatibility without needing access to a running
node during testing. To run these tests locally:

```bash
# From within the rpc crate
cargo test --all-features
```

The RPC client is also indirectly tested through the [Tendermint integration
tests](../tendermint/tests/integration.rs), which happens during
[CI](../.github/workflows/test.yml). All of these tests require a running
Tendermint node, and are therefore ignored by default. To run these tests
locally:

```bash
# In one terminal, spin up a Tendermint node
docker pull tendermint/tendermint:latest
docker run -it --rm -v "/tmp/tendermint:/tendermint" \
    tendermint/tendermint init
docker run -it --rm -v "/tmp/tendermint:/tendermint" \
    -p 26657:26657 \
    tendermint/tendermint node --proxy_app=kvstore

# In another terminal, run the ignored Tendermint tests to connect to the node
# running at tcp://127.0.0.1:26657
cd ../tendermint
cargo test --all-features -- --ignored
```
